* Kick/op/voice from web admin
* Messages to channels from web admin
* Port plugins
* Find a way to do something similar to the IrcString class in perl
* Some way of seeing/editing helper config
* Maybe special bus messages for mode changes, given their complexity
* A stay dead feature if more than one exception occurs in N minutes
* message_sent should have target
* ubot.channel.set_limit
* ubot.channel.set_key
* better set_mode
* Nicer ban handling
* Make lart use a database
* Notice handling
* Invite and mode seem not to work
* Better way of handling multiple bots on the same D-Bus
  * Web interface will list them as helpers
  * Maybe plugins should have a bots setting instead of bot. Or a per-bot section
