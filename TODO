Core
----
* Better handling of channel modes. Suggestions:
 - Maybe special bus messages for mode changes, given their complexity
 - ubot.channel.set_limit
 - ubot.channel.set_key
 - Nicer ban handling, including ban_user/unban_user methods
* A stay dead feature if more than one exception occurs in N minutes
* OutMessage should have a target attribute
* Notice handling
* Better way of handling multiple bots on the same D-Bus
  * Web interface will list them as helpers (Not anymore as they're no longer services)
  * Maybe plugins should have a bots setting instead of bot. Or a per-bot section

Bindings
--------
* Perl IrcString class
* Port nick-as-prefix to ruby/perl
* Port get_user and register_permission to ruby/perl
* Make database accessible to helpers (get_dsn?)

Web admin
---------
* Per-nick actions (kick, op, mode etc...)
* Editing configs

Helpers
-------
* Documentation for agenda, encyclopedia, users and bugtracker
* Document 'ubot send -H -I'
* Port bugtracker
* Make lart use a database
* Make sure prefix-stripping didn't harm other helpers
* Web interface to packages/factoids
* apt-file integration
* Timezone interface
* Bugtracker should support jira, and RT (perl/cpan)
